# PS Preference Filler (Java)
(April 2013)

**Update**
I made a javascript version of this with improved user experince a year later. Check out its repository too.

A Java based application meant to assist students in creating their preference order for the list of Practice School stations at BITS Pilani.

The original web bsaed form provided by the institute was a bit... ummm... tacky, and extremely difficult to fill out. I copied the list of stations from that web form into "ps1 list.txt", read it using the Java application and present a UI for students to generate a list of their preference. The output is "PSPReferece.txt" which contains the students preference in a format which makes it easier for them to fill it out on the default institute provided form.
